Implement the following C++ function: 
 	int StringSearch (string filename, string pattern) 

The function receives as input a file name for a text file containing English text, and a string of text. It returns the number of occurrences of the specified string in the file. 

Your main function should receive a file name and a string from the command line, call the StringSearch function with the provided file name and string, and print out the output returned by the function. 

For example, suppose that you compile your program to the executable Problem4, for the provided TextFile.txt file, and string "file " (note that the last character is space), your program should be run as follows:
	> Problem4 TextFile.txt "file "

and should only print the output of the function, 6 in this case.

Submit your solution in a single file, Problem4.cpp.
