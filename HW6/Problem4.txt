main.cpp output:
Longest Word Length: 124
Valid Passwords: 18250736
Number of valid dictionary words: 51

Explanation:
a) For each word in Big Data, compare the length of each word until you have checked all the words and find the greatest length.

b) For each each word in Big Data, check if it is between 8 and 20 character, has at least one uppercase and one lowercase increase the
number of words that could count as a password by one.  Uses three boolean flags to check if all three conditions are met.

c)We used a Trie data structure to keep track of every dictionary word. We then traversed through our BigData text file,
iterating through each word and searching for the word in the trie, using the search function.
If found, we then checked if it contained an r, t, and l, if it didnâ€™t, our WordCount was increased by 1. In the end we returned the WordCount.
